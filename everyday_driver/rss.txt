			<description><![CDATA[<p>How do you know if you’re being too hard on your car – will it last, even with proper maintenance? James A. in Boston asks if he’s killing his car, and which one he should aspire to next. Then, Sakshi J. writes on behalf of her husband, who seems commitment-phobic, and she wishes he would buy anything next. Social media questions ask why the Japanese haven’t made a genuine competitor to German sports sedans, how do you ask your boss for a ride in a car he hasn’t revealed, and has there ever been such a seismic shift like the era we’re in?</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;When your heart wants a truck, but you really need a commuter, what do you do? Suggestions for in-between vehicles rule the debate for Hunt B. in Nashville TN.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Topic Tuesday discusses the sentiment of never meeting your heroes! Nick F. has always liked the Mk.IV Toyota Supra, and finds himself in a position to buy one. Adam in Michigan has a great garage but an extremely short commute – his cars aren’t getting driven very much, and he wonders what a better mix of cars would be. Social media questions ask if you should drive with your mouth open or closed while wearing a helmet on track, how do you safely detail an engine bay, and should the next affordable car be a fun sports car or a 4x4?</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Topic Tuesday discusses the sentiment of never meeting your heroes! Nick F. has always liked the Mk.IV Toyota Supra, and finds himself in a position to buy one. Adam in Michigan has a great garage but an extremely short commute – his cars aren’t getting driven very much, and he wonders what a better mix of cars would be. Social media questions ask if you should drive with your mouth open or closed while wearing a helmet on track, how do you safely detail an engine bay, and should the next affordable car be a fun sports car or a 4x4?&lt;/p&gt;

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Wanting to own a fun sports car isn’t a mid-life crisis, it’s a life-long crisis! Anthony B. in Denver, CO wants two cars on opposite ends of the Spectrum Of Sacrifice. Dennis F. is a huge fan of Hondas and currently resto-modding an old Prelude, but thinks S2000’s might quickly rise in value and wondering if he should get one soon? Social media questions ask what car is the backbone of American society, what would the guys name their own car companies, and is an Evora still worthy without the supercharger?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[464: Omnipresent Noise, Listen To The Whistle, Think Of The Kids]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Season 6 begins on the Motor Trend cable channel, Saturday, January 4, 2020. Never having driven a spectrum of fun cars is a great opportunity and a clean driving slate – that’s the position that Light J. is in, and he’s even looking for something impractical! Also, Neal K’s young kids love going fast, and he is compelled to feed their need for speed while also impressing clients. Social media questions touch on how to tell a friend they could use some driving skills help, the car chase scene in the Netflix film 6Underground, and the guys’ confidence in availability of the upcoming Tesla Roadster.</p>

But they’d rather debate the validity of sports cars if they’re not lightweight! Brandon S. in Portland, OR is moving to Colorado and ready for his first sporty car, but he’s not sure what the roads will be like, so the guys factor in budget, insurance costs and commuting. Audience questions on social media cover dealerships and their ability to properly sell electric cars, rising values on late model cars, and hooning at any age…&lt;/p&gt;

Drew in southwest Missouri used to be satisfied with his old Volvo wagon, but is now nurturing a BMW sedan fetish, and carefully planning a future purchase to accommodate a family. Luis writes about his passion for design and bug-eyed cars, and asks for choices on an older, reliable, easy-to-mod fun car that checks off those requirements. Finally, the guys talk about the issue that really affects electric car reviews, autocross vs. big-track days, and some resources to feed the car design itch.

			<description><![CDATA[There are many great cars, but there's also simply good ones that don’t always get a recommendation or mention. The guys discuss some alternatives to their favorite segments that might not stand out quite as much, but appeal more to different buyers. They debate whether or not Dustin M. in Oakland bought a good car, and ultimately, should he defend his purchase and upgrade it, or cave in and buy something else? Social media questions cover subjects like the permission to test drive, the tricky Elise clamshell, and will American companies ever again build a RWD enthusiast sedan?

			<description><![CDATA[Driving cars in their country of origin could be a bucket list all by itself, so during the time period that Matt H. works as an English teacher in rural Japan, he wants to experience the local car flavors and roads there.
